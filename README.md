# Find Food App

An app that groups friends together who can't decide on where to eat. It introduces local restaurants in a tinder-like fashion, allowing the friends to swipe right on the places they want to eat and left on the ones they don't. Once everyone has gone through, it will select the restaurant based on group majority.
